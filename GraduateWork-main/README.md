# Info about Project
This work is provided for completion of studies at the College of Information Technology KNITU-KAI. This work is provided in two parts: the `server part` and the `client part`. API requests will occur in the server part, but in the client part the user will be given the opportunity to interact with the site in some way.

# Additional installation of utilities
For the server to work correctly, you need to perform two actions:
1) `npm (yarn) install` - connection of NodeJs libraries, which are located in the "package.json" file;
If there are any errors, please write the following:
2) `npm (yarn) install sequelize express pg pg-hstore express-fileupload cors dotenv nodemon uuid jsonwebtoken bcrypt` -  connection of needed NodeJs libraries.

For the client to work correctly, you need to perform two actions:
1) `npm (yarn) install` - connection of NodeJs libraries, which are located in the "package.json" file;
If there are any errors, please write the following:
2) `npm (yarn) install mobx mobx-react-lite axios react-router-dom node-sass` -  connection of needed NodeJs libraries.

# Project launch (the site)
In order for the site to interact correctly, first you need to turn on the `server` first, then the `client` part.
#
1) `npm (yarn) run dev` - turn the server part;
2) `npm (yarn) start` - turn the client part.
#

# Project launch (WPF application)
